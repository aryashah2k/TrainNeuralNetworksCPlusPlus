Neural networks are everywhere, and chances are you are using them every day. When you're shopping online and a product you like pops up, when you see a weather forecast and why not when you use your smartphone. We will create a neural network from scratch in C++. Whether you are starting your journey into artificial intelligence and machine learning, or you have some experience with neural networks with popular tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow and you'd like to brush up on the basics. 

Although professional tools allow you to train neural networks from a high level perspective, the objective of this course is to give you a chance to tap into the details of the algorithms behind neural networks. 

This will allow you to fully understand what's going on inside, and you'll make much better use of professional machine learning tools in the future.
