Next steps

I hope you have fun learning how to use C++ to create neural networks. Of course, there's so much more you can learn about neural networks. So as next steps, I suggest the following. Put your models to the test by using training, validation, and testing datasets. Assess your neural networks for usual problems like overfitting and underfitting. Experiment with more hidden layers and with more or less neurons per layer. 

And you may want to try all of these things with a readily available neural network tool, like TensorFlow or PyTorch, instead of writing the code all by yourself. Thank you for taking the course. Now I'll leave you to get to work on your next neural network application. Till next time.
