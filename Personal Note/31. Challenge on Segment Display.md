Challenge: Design your own SDR neural network

Here's a system level challenge for you: design your own segment display recognition neural network. We'll give some thought to the design first, so please don't write any code just yet. Instead, try to answer this question: how would you recognize numbers from 0 to 9? Think about the dimensions of your multilayer perceptron. We already know that we want seven inputs because we'll receive seven brightness levels, one for each segment, but try to answer these questions: how many inputs and outputs would you use? 

How many hidden layers and how many neurons per hidden layer would you use? And also, try to think how you want the data to be presented at the output of your neural network. Your solution should be a diagram like this one, showing the inputs, the neurons, their connections, and the outputs. Don't worry about showing the bias inputs for all neurons. They will be there, just not in the diagram. Give some thought to this. As with many computing problems, this is one of the most important steps. This should take you about 15 minutes.
