Solution: Finish the perceptron

Here's my solution. As you can see, both functions are one-liners. First, to set the weights, I'm simply assigning the argument to the classes weight. That's possible because the assignment operator for the vector class, makes a copy of the source vector. 

As for the Sigmoid function, it's simply written as the definition we saw earlier. I used the standard library's exponential function for this. That's it, we are now ready to test our neuron. But first, let's give some meaning to our test.
