Why C++?

So here are some of the most important aspects about C++ I'd like you to know. First, C++ runs the world. It's undoubtedly one of the most popular programming languages of all times. And you can see its applications everywhere, in operating systems, database software, web browsers, banking, cloud systems, compilers, embedded systems, you name it. 
There are lots of libraries available for pretty much any application of machine learning, and this includes lots of neural network variants in PyTorch and TensorFlow. Lastly, you may run your code anywhere because we'll only use the Standard Template Library. That's why I don't expect you to have any platform-related trouble when setting up your environment or trying out your code.
