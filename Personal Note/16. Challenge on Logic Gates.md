Challenge: Logic gates with perceptrons

Ready for your next challenge? Your task is to make your perceptron behave as a two input OR gate. Here's the truth table for the OR gate. And this is what the classification problem looks like. So, to be clear what you need to do is come up with a combination of weights that will make the perceptron behave as an OR gate. 

It may help to fill out the z column of this table first. Remember, you want a negative sum whenever you want the output to be zero and a positive sum for one. Go ahead and tweak the code to test your new OR gate. 

This shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes, especially because you may use the provided code, which is a modification of the AND gate code you just saw.
