What is a neural network?

Let's start by defining what a neural network is. A neural network is a piece of software. It's a model of the brain. And like so, it's capable of reproducing some behaviors of the brain, like learning and classifying. That is, it can be taught to recognize the category of a set of things you present to it. 

For example, telling the difference between apples and oranges in a picture. Now let's consider what a neural network is not so that we get some misconceptions out of the way. A neural network is not a series of if/then statements or any other form of hard coded data the software may fetch to produce an answer. 

A neural network is not all there is to machine learning. In fact, you'll see that machine learning is an extensive field of knowledge on its own. And lastly, although neural networks are useful for classifying, they are certainly not the only type of classifier out there. 

Now I'd like to give you an idea of what constitutes a neural network. Simply put, a neural network is a collection of neurons, which are small computing units that perform simple calculations to collectively solve a problem. These neurons may be interconnected in several ways. In the illustration, I'm showing the multi-layer perceptron, a very popular type of neural network and the one we will implement up ahead.
