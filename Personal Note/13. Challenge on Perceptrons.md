Challenge: Finish the perceptron

Ready for your first challenge? Let's finish up the perceptron class. In order to test the class, we'll need to be able to set the weights as specific values. So we need the set weights function you see at line 24. And remember, we'll use a sigmoid as the activation function. 

So that's the second thing you'll have to write starting at line 28. So once again, your task is to write two class functions, the sigmoid activation function and a separate function to write values to the weights. For the argument, receive a vector of doubles. 

You may or may not validate that the length of this vector matches the number of inputs in the neuron, including the bias. This is not crucial because we'll use it for simple tests. This should take you about 15 minutes.
